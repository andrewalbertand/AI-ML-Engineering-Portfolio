Algorithm Developed: Genomic Variant Classifier for Neurodegenerative Diseases (PD, AD, MS) 

Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a sophisticated AI-driven tool capable of classifying genetic variants as indicative of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The emphasis was on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to interpret complex genomic data, thereby aiding in the early detection and understanding of these neurodegenerative diseases. 

Why a Random Forest Classifier? 

The Random Forest algorithm was chosen due to its robustness and efficiency in handling large datasets with multiple features. This ensemble learning method is particularly adept at reducing overfitting, thereby ensuring more reliable predictions. Its ability to handle the intricacies of genomic data, such as allele changes and gene impacts, makes it an ideal choice for this kind of analysis. 

Dataset and Feature Selection:

The project involved creating a dataset of over 1,200 instances, each meticulously curated to ensure high-quality and relevant genetic information. Key features included: 

Allele Change: Critical in understanding genetic variations. 
Allele Frequency: Provides insights into the commonality of the variants. 
Conservation Score: Indicates the evolutionary preservation of genetic sequences, shedding light on their importance. 
Gene Affected: Essential for linking variants to specific diseases. 
Functional Impact: Helps determine the actual effect of the variant on the gene function. 
Performance Metrics: 

The classifier achieved an accuracy and F1 score of 80%, demonstrating its effectiveness in genomic variant classification. These metrics were chosen as they provide a balanced view of the model’s performance, accounting for both precision and recall. This level of accuracy is particularly significant in the context of genomic research, where the correct identification of disease-associated variants is crucial. 

Visualizations: 

To illustrate the model’s decision-making process and performance, several visual aids are used: 

Feature Importances Plot: Highlights the weight of each feature in the model’s predictions. 
ROC Curve: Demonstrates the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. 
Confusion Matrix: Provides a clear picture of the model’s prediction accuracy and instances of misclassification. 

Application in R&D: 

This proprietary technology is currently being utilized in-house at SensusGen AI for advanced genomic research. Its application is crucial in exploring new correlations between genetic markers and neurodegenerative diseases, paving the way for potential therapeutic breakthroughs. 


Significance and Impact: 

This classifier’s ability to accurately predict disease associations based on genomic variants represents a significant advancement in the field of bioinformatics. It opens new avenues for personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored based on an individual’s genetic makeup, and contributes to the broader understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. 

Future Directions: 

Going forward, the methodologies and learnings from this project can be applied to other complex genomic analysis tasks. There is potential to expand the model’s application to include other diseases and to integrate it with other forms of biomedical data for more comprehensive insights.  ![download (1)](https://github.com/andrewalbertand/AI-ML-Engineering-Portfolio/assets/71141011/451c4b91-d09b-4117-9288-ded591ad3714)
